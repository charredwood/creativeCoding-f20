# Alternative Story Device

This is a final project for the course using JavaScript p5js library plus RiTa. Kindly find the details in the code. The primary code needs the Arduino circuit to run properly. If you want to test how it works without the physical interface, please check 'finalProject-demo.js' instead of 'finalProject.js' file. The demo code is also available here(https://editor.p5js.org/sagecj/sketches/amYGnYQb-) in case you'd like to take a look at this before downloading.
